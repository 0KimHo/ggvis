* TODO Identify and pledge yourself

1) In Emacs, replace the placeholder ~[yourname]~ at the top of this
   file by your own name and write ~(pledged)~ next to it
2) Go with the cursor on the headline and change the ~TODO~ label to ~DONE~
   by entering ~S-<right>~ ("Shift + right-arrow").
   
* Question
 What factors should one consider when applying for a job in the data
 science field?
* Reason
- As data science students, it would benefit us to understand
how different factors could impact our future salaries. We chose ggvis to
learn more about the package's capabilities for visualizing and
interacting with a dataset.
* ggvis
- Quick Facts:
~ incorporates ggplot2 reactive framework of Shiny, web graphic features from
Vega, and dplyr's grammar of data transformation
~ Interactive graphics (such as sliders)
~ Basic commands: 
 "%>%" = pipe operator
 "~" = sqiuggle operator
 "=" = assign scaled value
 ":=" assign unscaled value

* Notes on the Dataset
~ The data was found on Kaggle and aggregated by ai-jobs.net Salaries
  -  ai.jobs.net was launched in October of 2018 and is owned by
    foorfilla LLC, a small tech company based in Zurich
   Taken from ai-jobs.net:
   #+begin_quote
   "This site collects salary information anonymously
   from professionals all over the world in the AI, ML,
   Data Science space and makes it publicly available for
   anyone to use, share and play around with."
   
   #+end_quote
~ All jobs are full-time from 2020-2022.
~ Experience levels were given the following numerical values:
  0 - None/Entry Level
  1 - Junior/Mid Level
  2 - Senior/Intermediate Level
  3 - Executive/Expert Level

* TODO Install and load packages
- To begin, install and load the package ggvis
#+begin_src R

#+end_src

* TODO Read the .csv file
#+begin_src R
  dsc_jobs <- ______("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacksonwharrod/glowing-octo-telegram/main/ds_salaries%20-%20ds_salaries.csv")
#+end_src

* TODO Check the structure of ~dsc_jobs~
#+begin_src R
  
#+end_src

* TODO Choosing which job_titles to barplot
** TODO How many job titles are listed in the data set?
- Print the table of job titles
 #+begin_src R
   _____(dsc_jobs$_____)

 #+end_src
 
-  Check the length of the table
   
 #+begin_src R
  
  _____(table(dsc_jobs$job_title))

 #+end_src


 
** TODO Convert the table into a matrix
- There are too many jobs to include in a barplot, so let's extract
  the jobs with the most entries in the dataset. First, create a
  matrix using as.matrix
  
#+begin_src R
  top_jobs <- _____(table(dsc_jobs$job_title))
 
#+end_src


** TODO Extraction
- Filter out jobs with number of entries > 10 using ~which~ and assign those jobs to
  top_jobs
  
#+begin_src R
  top_jobs <- ____(______[__]__)
  top_jobs

#+end_src

** TODO Create a dataframe
- Since we want to make a barplot, our next step is to create a
  dataframe of the matrix
#+begin_src R
  top7_jobs <-  ________(top_jobs)
  ## check the structure of the data frame
  _________
  
  
#+end_src


- We want to have 7 observations and two variables
#+begin_src R
  
  top7_jobs <- data.frame(Job_Title = c("Data Analyst",
                                        "Data Architect",
                                        "Data Engineer",

** TODO Barplot of Most In-Demand Jobs
- We will now create a barplot of the most common jobs in the
  dsc_jobs dataset using ~ggvis~ and ~layer_bars()~
  #+begin_src R :results graphics file :file barplot1.png
    top7_jobs %>%
    ____(x=~_______, y=~________) %>%
    ________ 

  #+end_src

*** TODO Widen Graph
- Make the plot larger so the x-axis labels are easier to read using ~set_options~
#+begin_src R 
  top7_jobs %>%
    ggvis(x=~Job_Title, y=~count) %>%
    layer_bars() %>%
    
    ## use the arguments height and width
    _______(_____, ______) 

 #+end_src

*** TODO Add Title and Axis Labels
#+begin_src R
  top7_jobs %>%
    ggvis(x=~Job_Title, y=~count) %>%
    layer_bars() %>%

    ##make plot larger so x-axis labels are easier to read using ~set_options~
    set_options(height=400, width=900) %>%

    ##add title by setting orient to "top" in  add_axis
    ______("x", _____=____,
             ticks = 0,
             properties = axis_props(axis=list(stroke="white"),
             labels = list(fontSize = 0)),

    ##include the axis titles using add_axis
    _______("x", title = ________) %>%
    _______("y", title = ________) 

#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
  
* TODO Salary in Relation to Experience Level and Job Title (Scatter Plot)
- To create a scatterplot, use ~ggvis()~, ~layer_points()~, and ~group_by()~.
- Set x to experience_level and y to salary_in_usd in ~ggvis.~
- The argument for ~layer_points~ is fill, set to job_title.
- ~group_by~ takes the same argument as fill.
  
#+begin_src R
    dsc_jobs %>%
    ggvis(_________, __________) %>%
    _________(____=______) %>%
    ______(______)
 
#+end_src

** TODO Enlarge Graph & Add Axes
- There is a lot of data squished onto the chart right now, so use
  ~set_options~ with the arguments ~height~ and ~width~ to make the chart
  larger.
- Use ~add_axis~ to title the x-axis and y-axis.
  
#+begin_src R
    dsc_jobs %>%
    ggvis(~experience_level, ~salary_in_usd) %>%
    layer_points(fill=~job_title) %>%
    group_by(job_title) %>%

  ##make plot larger so points and y-axis are easier to read
    _______(height=___, width=___) %>%
    
  ##add x- and y- axes with labels
    add_axis(___, title = "Experience Level") %>%
    add_axis(___, title = "Salary (USD)")
#+end_src

** TODO Axis customization
- Notice that in the previous plot, the y-axis title and y-axis labels
  overlap. There are two ways to deal with this issue.
*** TODO 1) Rotate axis label
#+begin_src R
  dsc_jobs %>%
  ggvis(~experience_level, ~salary_in_usd) %>%
  layer_points(fill=~job_title) %>%
  group_by(job_title) %>%

  ##make plot larger so points and y-axis are easier to read
  set_options(height=900, width=600) %>%
    
  ##add x- and y- axes with labels and rotate the y-axis labels so they are not covering the y-axis title (use axis_props)
  add_axis("x", title = "Experience Level") %>%
  add_axis("y", title = "Salary (USD)", properties = ________(_____ = list(angle=___, align="left", baseline = "middle")))
#+end_src

*** TODO 2)  Offset title
#+begin_src R
  dsc_jobs %>%
  ggvis(~experience_level, ~salary_in_usd) %>%
  layer_points(fill=~job_title) %>%
  group_by(job_title) %>%

  ##make plot larger so points and y-axis are easier to read
  set_options(height=900, width=600) %>%
    
  ##add x- and y- axes with labels and offset the y-axis title (use title_offset)
  add_axis("x", title = "Experience Level") %>%
  add_axis("y", title = "Salary (USD)", ______ = ____)
#+end_src

** TODO Add title to scatterplot
#+begin_src R
  dsc_jobs %>%
  ggvis(~experience_level, ~salary_in_usd) %>%
  layer_points(fill=~job_title) %>%
  group_by(job_title) %>%

  ##make plot larger so points and y-axis are easier to read
  set_options(height=1500, width=600) %>%

  ##add x- and y- axes with labels and offset the y-axis title
  add_axis("x", title = "Experience Level") %>%
  add_axis("y", title = "Salary (USD)", title_offset = 70) %>%
    
  ##add title by setting orient to "top" in  ~add_axis~
  ________("x", orient=____,
           ticks = 0,
           properties = axis_props(axis=list(stroke="white")),
           title = "Data Science Salaries vs Experience Level and Job")

* Limitations
 ~ From exploring the website ai-jobs.net, the data seems to be
 self-reported. The site is not clear on their system of validating
 the data.
 ~ The sample size of the dataset is relatively small.
